           <h1 >About The Book</h1>
           <p>Born a Crime is a true story written by Trevor Noah, a famous comedian from South Africa.
             The book talks about his life growing up during apartheid, a time when black and white people 
             were not treated equally in South Africa.
            Trevor was born to a black mother and a white father, which was illegal at that time—so he was "born a crime." 
            He shares funny, sad, and powerful stories about his childhood, his strong and loving mother, and the challenges he faced because of racism and poverty.
           The book shows how Trevor used humor, hope, and courage to survive and succeed. It teaches us about family, injustice, and never giving up.</p>

                “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 
                'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”

            <p>
                The quote from Trevor Noah's "Born a Crime" highlights a complex issue about love and control in relationships.
                 Abel wants a traditional marriage, but he also desires a woman who is free. 
                 This contradiction shows how some men may want a partner who is independent yet still want to keep them in a limited role.
                In my society, traditional gender roles often expect women to be obedient and focused on family.
                Many girls grow up believing that their main goal should be to marry and take care of the home. 
                This can create a feeling of being trapped, much like the "cage" Abel imagines.
                 For example, there are still many families that discourage girls from pursuing education or careers, pushing them instead towards marriage at a young age.
                However, I see a change happening. More women  in my society are standing up for their rights and seeking education and careers. 
                They want partners who support their dreams instead of trying to control them.  
                This shift is important because it shows that women can be both independent and loving partners.
             Personally,I want a relationship built on respect and equality. I believe that love should not mean giving up my freedom or dreams.
              Instead, it should be about supporting each other’s goals.
           In conclusion, Abel's desire for a traditional wife who is also free reflects the struggle many face today.
           We need to challenge these old ideas about gender roles and create relationships where both partners can thrive without feeling trapped.
            True love should empower us, not cage us.

            <p> I would rename "Born a Crime" to "Growing Up in a Divided World" 
              It emphasizes how he grew up in a sciety that was split by race and unfair laws.
              This highlights the idea of living in a world where people are treated differently based on their skin color.
            It highlights his experiences and struggles while growing up in a world full of rules that kept people apart.
